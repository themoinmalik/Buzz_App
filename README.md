# Buzz

 Buzz project is a social media app within the ToTheNew organization. It is built using ReactJS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. The app utilizes Single Sign-On (SSO) for user login. The primary purpose of the app is to enable communication and sharing of thoughts among the organization's members.

The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to create, edit, and delete their posts. Users can also like, comment, and share posts with their friends. The app also includes features like notifications, user profiles, and privacy settings.

To ensure secure and efficient communication, the app uses end-to-end encryption for all messages. This ensures that only the intended recipients can view the content of the messages.

The app's backend is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS. This allows for efficient handling of user requests and data storage. The app also utilizes SSO for user authentication, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience.

The app's frontend is built using ReactJS. This allows for the creation of a responsive and interactive user interface. The app is also designed to be accessible, ensuring that it can be used by users with disabilities.

Overall, my buzz project aims to provide a platform for communication and sharing of thoughts within the thenew organization. It offers a user-friendly interface and secure login experience, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

I created this project as final assessment proejct as an intern.
